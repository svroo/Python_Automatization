    "### Searching and reading local files\n",

    "In this chapter, we will introduce the basic operations to read information from files, starting with searching and opening files stored in different directories and subdirectories. Then, we'll describe some of the most common file types and how to read them, including formats such as raw text files, PDFs, and Word documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last recipe will seach for a word inside different kinds of files, recursively in a directory tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the following recipes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crawling and searching directories\n",
    "- Reading text files\n",
    "- Dealing with encodings\n",
    "- Reading CSV files\n",
    "- Reading log files\n",
    "- Reading file metadata\n",
    "- Reading images\n",
    "- Reading PDF files\n",
    "- Reading Word documents\n",
    "- Scanning documents for a keyword\n",

    "\n",

    "contained there. That will include all the files in subdirectories. The matched files \n",
    "can be of a particular kind, like text files, or every single one of them.\n",
    "This is normally a starting operation when dealing with files, to detect all the \n",
    "existing ones.\n",

    "### Getting ready\n",

    "$ touch dir/file6.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
